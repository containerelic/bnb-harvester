# BNB Harvester

A collection of Python utility scripts for managing BNB tokens on both BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and opBNB networks. This toolkit allows you to check balances and consolidate funds from multiple wallet addresses into a single wallet.

## Features

- **Balance Checking**: Query token balances across multiple wallet addresses
- **Fund Consolidation**: Transfer tokens from multiple wallets to a single destination
- **Network Support**: Works with both BNB Smart Chain and opBNB networks
- **Address Deduplication**: Remove duplicate addresses from your address list
- **Fee Optimization**: Automatically calculates and optimizes transaction fees

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/containerelic/bnb-harvester.git
    cd bnb-harvester
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Preparing Your Files

1. Copy and edit the example files:
    ```
    cp examples/address_sample.txt data/address.txt
    cp examples/private_keys_sample.txt data/private_keys.txt
    ```
   
2. Run the deduplication tool to create `data/unique_address.txt`:
    ```
    python src/remove_duplicates.py
    ```
    
3. For sending tokens, make sure your `data/private_keys.txt` file contains the private keys that correspond to the addresses you want to send from.

### Required Files

The project uses the following text files:

| File Name | Description | Created By |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `data/address.txt` | List of wallet addresses to check | User (manually) |
| `data/unique_address.txt` | Deduplicated list of addresses | Generated by `src/remove_duplicates.py` |
| `data/private_keys.txt` | Private keys for sending transactions | User (manually) |

Sample files with the correct format are included in the `examples/` directory.

### Checking Balances

**BNB Smart Chain:**
```
python src/bnb_checker.py
```

**opBNB Network:**
```
python src/opbnb_checker.py
```

### Sending Tokens

**Important:** Before sending tokens, make sure to:
1. Set your target wallet address by editing the `TARGET_WALLET` variable in the sender scripts
2. Ensure your `data/private_keys.txt` file is properly secured and never shared

**BNB Smart Chain:**
```
python src/bnb_sender.py
```

**opBNB Network:**
```
python src/opbnb_sender.py
```

## Security Notes

- **NEVER** share your `data/private_keys.txt` file
- Keep your private keys secure at all times
- Test with small amounts before transferring larger values
- Verify the `TARGET_WALLET` address carefully before running sender scripts

## Fee Configuration

The scripts have default fee settings that should work for most scenarios, but you may need to adjust them based on current network conditions:

### BNB Smart Chain
- Default Gas Price: 5 Gwei
- Gas Limit: 21,000 (standard transfer)
- Safety Margin: 0.00003 BNB

### opBNB Network
- Default Gas Price: 0.001 Gwei
- Gas Limit: 30,000 (standard transfer uses ~28,075)
- Safety Margin: 0.0000002 BNB
